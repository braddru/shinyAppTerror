This was one of three unsuccessful coordinated attacks timed to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir's visit to the United States. The other two involved similar devices in cars parked near an El Al Airlines warehouse at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and at a second Israeli bank on Fifth Avenue. The devices failed to detonate due to faulty circuitry. They were discovered and defused on March 7, after the explosive-laden cars had been towed to an impound lot. On March 15, officials issued an arrest warrant for 27-year-old Iraqi citizen Khalid Dahham Al-Jawary, identified as a Black September operative. Al-Jawary was arrested in January 1991, convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison in 1993, and released and deported from the United States in 2009.",1,1,1,0,,,1,0,0,3,Bombing/Explosion,,,,,1,Business,3,Bank/Commerce,"Israel Discount Bank, Ltd.",Bank Building,97,Israel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Black September,,,,,,,0,,,0,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,6,Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite,15,Vehicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,Two 5-gallon containers of gasoline with timing devices.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Bomb is Defused at El Al Facility: Explosives also Found in Car Near Israeli Bank,"" March 8, 1973.","Tolchin, Martin.

They were found in the front seat of their car parked in the lot behind the Local 980 United Automobile Workers Union Hall across the street from the Ford plant on Route 1, where the brothers were employed. The perpetrators were members of the New World sect, as were the brothers, who were apparently killed due to disobeying orders. This event was one in a series of related Black Muslim attacks.

On October 18, 1973, two more Black Muslim dissidents are killed and beheaded by others in the New World sect in the midst of feuding Black Muslim factions.  This case in particular may not be terrorism because the Bankston brothers were allegedly murdered for disobeying orders so this is a case of inner-party conflict.  Also, two members of the New World, Albert Chavies and Lamont Calloway, were later convicted for the murder of the Bankston brothers.

The perpetrator, J.C. Simon, who perceived Erakat to be a white man, entered the grocery store, greeted Erakat, and then ordered him to the bathroom in the back of the shop, demanded Erakat to kneel on his knees, tied his hands behind his back, and shot Erakat in the back of his head with a .32 caliber gun, using a quilt to muffle the gunshot sounds. Additionally, Simon emptied both the safe and the cash register, taking with him about $1300.  It came out in trial that the bloody hand print of Anthony C. Harris was also found at the crime scene inside the store.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

The fourth shot, aimed at her head, missed DeMartini as she collapsed to the ground.  As she yelled, another car then drive toward DeMartini in an attempt to kill her, but she rolled herself under the Mustang to dodge the .32 caliber bullets, and thus survived.

Smith died almost instantly, from the .32 caliber gun shot wounds.  The perpetrator fled on foot, but was later identified by eye-witnesses to be J.C. Simon.  Anthony C. Harris, witness for the prosecution during the trial, said that he was back at the car waiting for Simon and Manuel Moore to return, after he heard the gunshots. Both Simon and Moore were accused of the murders in trial. The perpetrators were black muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

As the two were walking up Geary Boulevard nearing Webster, they were passed by a black man, who then turned around and stopped, and then proceeded to shoot both cadets in their backs twice with his .32 caliber gun as they attempted to run.  The two bullets that hit Story, hit her in the waist (missing her spine), causing her to collapse to the ground, and resulting in the third bullet subsequently missing her altogether. Rainwater died, but Story survived the ordeal.  No nearby witnesses, nor Story, were able to identify the perpetrators, but police officers believe this was yet another attack by the Zebra killers.

The bomb exploded in one of the coin-operated public lockers near the ticketing area of the terminal, and caused considerable damage including shattering several huge plate glass windows and leaving a 10 by 15 foot hole in the wall.  Kurbegovic apparently belonged to no organization and had no outside support; however, in a tape sent to the Herald-Examiner, he claimed he was the military officer of a group he called ""Aliens of America.""

This may be a purely criminal act because Kurbegovic's motivations stemmed from personal vendetta's against a judge and commissioners who would not allow him to open up his own business, though he did have some political motivations as well. Kurbegovic claimed this attack by sending an audiotape to a CBS affiliate explaining his alphabet bombing method.  Kurbegovic also claimed responsibility for other attempted bombings, even though police doubt some of his claims.
