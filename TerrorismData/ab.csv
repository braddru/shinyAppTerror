After negotiating with authorities, they released 12 hostages under the condition that the two shooters and the remaining hostages be allowed to travel to Larnaca Airport.  At the airport, the gunmen boarded a plane, along with 11 hostages and 4 volunteers from the flight crew.  Once in the air, the gunmen requested to land in Libya, Kuwait, Somalia, Greece and Sothern Yemen.  All 5 denied them permission to land.  The plane eventually landed in Djibouti and refueled.

Cikoja was on his way to his own car, when he collapsed on the front stoop.  Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident because Cikoja had received a threat letter , three months prior to his murder, from a group calling itself the ""Croatian Nationalist Army"", demanding that he pay $5,000 by August towards the group's cause for independence, or otherwise he would be killed. He refused to pay the money.

However, the letters sent to Yugoslav immigrants were signed by this group.  Additionally, it is unclear whether the letters may have been sent by the Yugoslav secret police in efforts to discredit the Croatian separatist movement, as some American-Croatian community leaders believe to be the case. This incident is linked to the firebombing, about a week later,  of a shop in Chicago, owned by an American of Croatian descent (197810040004) as well as the murder of another American of Croatian descent, Krizan Brkic, in California, who has also received a similar threatening letter (197811220002). In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents. Those indicted included Mile Markic (the alleged leader of Otpor in the U.S.), Mile Boban (the alleged president of Otpor in North America), Ante Ljubas, Andjelko Jakic (former vice president of the New York chapter of the group), Ivan Misetic (former vice president of the Chicago chapter),  Vinko Logarusic (leader of the Cleveland chapter), Ranko Primorac (leader of the Los Angeles chapter), Miro Biosic (treasurer of the L.A. chapter), and Drago Sudar (the associate of the other eight members of the group).

Whitfield survived and was treated for his wounds.  The Ku Klux Klan claimed responsibility for the attack and stated that Whitfield had no business being in Alabama and that the beating will teach him to stay out; the motive was that Whitfield had denounced the rape conviction of black man Tommy Lee Hines, for raping a white woman.  Earlier this day, Whitfield preached for three hours on the steps of the Cullman County courthouse, at which time he denounced the conviction, and was taunted by whites.

The march was in support of a mentally disabled black man who was charged with raping a white woman, and convicted by an all-white jury.  During the march, Klansmen blocked the street, disobeyed police orders to allow the marchers to pass, and opened gunfire, injuring two black marchers and five law enforcements officials.  Two Klansmen were also shot and wounded. In May 1984, ten Klansmen were charged in federal court for civil rights violations in a violent disruption of black marchers and police, and nine of the men were charged with the conspiracy of use of force or threat of force for purposes of intimidating parade participants because of their race.

Two women, both employees of the agency, and an off-duty police officer, were slightly injured by shards of flying glass from the explosion.  Additionally, the explosion destroyed the side wall of the agency, causing extensive damage, and also damaged a jewelry store on the first floor and the apartment of an elderly couple on the third floor.  Less than an hour after the blast, a man called the Associated Press and a local TV station, claiming bombing and identifying himself as a member of the Croatian Freedom Fighters.  He also stated that a message was left in a locker at the terminal at 421 Grand Central Station.  The message was written in Croatian and listed a series of demands that the group asked be aired on television and radio between 6pm and 7pm that evening, otherwise 2 more bombs, which were placed in congested areas, would be detonated at 8:30pm that evening. The group's message, which denounced  the Yugoslav Secret Police, and asked that the U.S. stop economic aid to Yugoslavia  and that political and economic ties to Yugoslavia by the U.S. and West Germany be broken, was aired, and no other bombs were detonated.",1,1,1,0,,,0,1,0,3,Bombing/Explosion,,,,,1,Business,11,Entertainment/Cultural/Stadium/Casino,Jet and Cruise Travel Agency,"travel agency, owned by Yugoslavian native",217,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Croatian Freedom Fighters,,,,,,"Croatian nationalists were seeking independence of Croatia from Yugoslavia, and wanted the U.S. and West Germany to stop providing economic aid and to break all political and economic ties with Yugoslavia.",0,,,0,-99,-99,1,2,Call (post-incident),,,,,,,,6,Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite,14,Time Fuse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,3,3,0,1,3,Minor (likely < $1 million),-99,"The explosion destroyed the side wall of the agency, causing extensive damage, and also damaged a jewelry store on the first floor and the apartment of an elderly couple on the third floor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Croatian Freedom Fighters claimed responsibility for the attack through both phone calls to the press following the explosion, and a message left in a locker at the Grand Central Terminal.","Robert McG.
