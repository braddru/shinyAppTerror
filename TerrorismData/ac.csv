The ambush left one serviceman slightly injured by broken glass which lightly grazed him.  The vehicle, which had no government markings, had just left the Las Americas expressway at an exit about one mile from the University of Puerto Rico, where three to four men were hiding under an underpass.  One perpetrator jumped out and opened fire on the government vehicle with a rifle, leaving 11 bullet holes in the vehicle.

The molotov cocktail was thrown through a bedroom window of the home of Bruce Meggett and Lucinda Harris, who were not home at the time of the incident.  Four children, ranging in ages from 6 years old to 15 years old, and their uncle were in the home when the lighted gasoline firebomb bounced off of the arm of the 6-year old girl and exploded, setting the home on fire.  No one was injured in the incident, but the fire caused $7,800 in damages to the home.  Though authorities believe that this incident had no involvement from the Ku Klux Klan, it occurred three weeks after the  Klan held its first public rally in the state in more than 70 years.  However, the bombing was intended to intimidate the family and other black families in the area, and infringe upon the family's housing rights. Charles N. Metheny and Eugene R.

Seward stated that the men attempted to collect debts they believed he owed them after accusing Seward of being a government agent and traitor.  The men cut Seward's hair, and threatened his life and the lives of his family members, and told him they knew where he ""cashed his government paycheck,"" all of which was untrue.  Timothy Wayne Snider and Richard Lee Roberts were arrested and charged with kidnapping.  One day prior to the incident, a Klansman called the Commercial Appeal newspaper and stated that a traitor to the Klan would be disciplined the next day, and then after the incident, another call came through notifying that the deed was done and the man could be found near the east Memphis area, where Seward was released.",0,1,1,0,,,0,1,0,6,Hostage Taking (Kidnapping),2,Armed Assault,,,14,Private Citizens & Property,84,Political Party Member/Rally,,"former KKK chaplain, William Seward",217,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ku Klux Klan,,,,,,Intimidation of target and those who decide to go against the KKK or help the government; an issue of inner-party conflict.,0,,,0,3,2,1,9,Other,,,,,,,,5,Firearms,5,Unknown Gun Type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,1,1,1,2,,,,0,,,,,,2,Hostage(s) released by perpetrators,,"This was a case of inner-party conflict where the goal was to intimidate a former KKK member, believed to be working with the government in some capacity, and send a larger message to anyone who betrays or goes against the Klan.
