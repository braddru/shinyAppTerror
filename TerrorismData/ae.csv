Then, another member of The Order, made a warning phone call to the cashier at the theater, but before any precautions could be taken, the bomb exploded, leaving minimal damage, destroying about 10 seats in the theater, and no casualties.

Using his car, Parmenter pinned the armored truck into a corner, while Pierce and Duey posed as window washers between an office supply store and a store called Bon Marche, concealing their weapons.  As George King was returning to the money compartment of the truck from Bon Marche, Pierce and Duey pulled their guns on King and the truck driver, Robert White, demanding they surrender their guns and get out of the truck or die.  At this point, Yarbrough pulled alongside with Mathews in their van, and Barnhill got out of the Chrysler he was driving, and also brandished a gun. Kemp was also at the scene with a shotgun, and the armored truck employees were forced to the back of the truck, while the perpetrators stole about $536,000 in cash and checks combined, $301,334 of which was in checks and subsequently burned.

Around 11am, the perpetrators called the Embassy Theater warning of a second bomb (although no bomb was present), hoping the police would take the threat seriously due to the bomb from the day before.  An hour later, around 12pm, about three hours prior to the robbery, the perpetrators unloaded several boxes of roofing nails into a highway tunnel, hoping to cause a traffic jam due to flat tires, and further divert police.  However, the traffic jam failed, and traffic proceeded as usual. Around 3:00pm, the robbery took place. All the perpetrators except Mathews and Parmenter were eventually captured, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.  Mathews died in a fire in the midst of a shoot out with police, when he refused to surrender, and Parmenter became a star witness for the prosecution in the Seattle trial, but was sentenced to prison time for his other crimes while in The Order.","Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, ""The Silent Brotherhood: Inside America's Racist Underground,"" The Free Press, Macmillan Inc., 1989.","Mark S.

The bomb, which was homemade by Pierce and consisted of three sticks of dynamite, an electric blasting cap, a battery, and a timer, caused minor damage to the synagogue's kitchen and heating equipment, in the amount of $4,000.  No casualties resulted from the blast, which Pierce later described as an ""act of war"" to serve ""the greater good,"" even though he initially intended the bombing to be a test of his homemade device.

During the trials for members of The Order, the judge stated that evidence about this bombing could not be presented in court, and prior testimony indicated that the bombing had not been sanctioned by Order leaders, it was an act conducted solely by Pierce and Kemp on their own to test the bomb, and other members of the group did not have prior knowledge of the incident; defense attorneys argued that it therefore could not be considered part of a racketeering conspiracy, and thus, it is doubtful that anyone was charged for this crime, but Pierce and Kemp were both later sentenced for their other crimes during their involvement with The Order.","Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, ""The Silent Brotherhood: Inside America's Racist Underground,"" The Free Press, Macmillan Inc., 1989.","Rory Marshall, ""Group's Leader Wanted To Declare War on Government, Former Member Says,"" The Associated Press, October 16, 1985.","National News Briefs, United Press International, April 30, 1984.",Hewitt Project,0,0,0,0,

After following and watching Berg's actions for a few hours on the night of his murder, at about 9:21pm, Robert Mathews, David Lane, and Bruce Carroll Pierce, watched Alan Berg pull into his driveway, at which point Pierce came up to Berg as he was exiting his Volkswagen Beetle, and shot him thirteen times point-blank in the head and body with a .45 caliber cartridges from a automatic Ingram MAC-10 machine gun.  Berg suffered about thirty-four wounds, and died instantly.  Four members of the group were indicted for his murder under the charges of violating Berg's civil rights: David Lane, Bruce Carroll Pierce, Jean Margaret Craig, who helped to gather information in an intelligence folder on Berg's life and whereabouts for about three weeks before his murder, and Richard Scutari, who helped to devise the plan of action for the murder.

In the midst of the robbery, the perpetrators, all but one, wearing bandannas over their faces, and one dressed in disguise as a woman, used a variety of firearms to stop the Brinks truck and its drivers and steal $3.6 million.  During the event, one perpetrator held up a note, reading ""Get out or die"" (similar to the note used in the April 23 armored truck robbery in Seattle, Washington).  Even though shots were fired, there were no injuries or casualties from the robbery.  However, the tires of the Brinks truck were shot flat to stop it.

After the men got away, they stopped at the Palmo Recreational area, where they switched cars, transferred all the money and belongings, and changed their clothes before pulling back onto the highway.  In addition to the twelve perpetrators who committed the robbery, a former Brink's employee, Charles E. Ostrout , acted as an accessory as he helped the group plan the robbery in advance by providing information on the truck driver's route.  Strout was eventually indicted, and sentenced to 5 years for racketeering.  Of the 12 perpetrators, Andrew Barnhill, Randolph Duey, James Dye, Randall Evans, Richard Kemp, Bruce Pierce, Gary Yarbrough, Robert Merki, Richard Scutari, Denver Parmenter were charged with armored car robbery and various other racketeering charges under the RICO Act.  It is unclear whether each of them was convicted for this particular incident, but overall, all ten of them were sentenced for their crimes with the Order after either trials or plea agreements, and received a range of prison sentences.  William Soderquist  walked free after he became a witness for the government and was placed in the witness protection program.
