There were no casualties in the incident, but the explosions caused about $50,000 in damages.  Daniel Allen Russell, Randy James Jones, and Stephen C. Ahern, all of Houston, were all charged and sentenced after their admissions to constructing and planting the bombs in the mosque.  It appears that the perpetrators acted independently of any group, and their reasons for the bombing, while conflicting, are suspected to be in retaliation and anger over American hostages being held in Lebanon during the Shiite Moslem hijacking of passengers aboard TWA Flight 847.  The bombing came in the midst of threatening phone calls to several area mosques and Islamic society headquarters after the hostage situation in Beirut.",1,1,1,1,2,Other Crime Type,0,1,0,3,Bombing/Explosion,,,,,15,Religious Figures/Institutions,86,Place of Worship,Daar Us Salaam mosque,mosque,217,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anti-Muslim extremists,,,,,,"Though there is conflicting information, the motive seems to be that the perpetrators were angry and retaliating for the holding of American hostages in Beirut during the Shiite Moslem hijacking of TWA Flight 847.",0,,,1,3,3,0,,,,,,,,,,6,Explosives/Bombs/Dynamite,14,Time Fuse,,,,,,,,,,,,,"homemade bombs built using galvanized pipes, black powder and a propane cylinder and a fuse",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,Minor (likely < $1 million),50000,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The explosions occurred at 11:30pm and witnesses reported seeing a man speeding away in a pickup truck yelling ""We did it, we did it.""  The perpetrators admitted that the bombings were in retaliation for the American hostage situation in Beirut after the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, but one of their attorneys did not believe this argument and claimed that the Moslem community did not need to feel threatened by the situation as the perpetrators were involved in mindless bombings of  a portable toilet, a trash bin, a car, a postal box, a newspaper box and a telephone booth in prior months.

Sprogis, and American citizen, was a former police chief in Nazi-occupied Latvia during World War II, and had been previously been accused of war crimes, but in deportation proceedings, all charges against him were dismissed.  At the time of the incident, it is suspected that a fire was set at Sprogis' home in order to have him evacuate the home via the front door, where an explosive was planted on his front steps.  Sprogis' neighbor Robert Seifried, saw the fire, and went to alert Sprogis, but inadvertently set off the bomb (meant for Sprogis), resulting in serious burns to his Seifried's right foot, leg and shoulder.  Damage to the home included shattered windows, destroyed aluminum siding, and other minor damage.
